# **FundedHero $2.5K Challenge Trading Plan**

**Strategy to pass Phase 1 & 2 and get funded on a $2,500 account.**

## **Objective**

* **Phase 1:** Hit **8% Profit ($200)** without breaching parameters.  
* **Phase 2:** Hit **5% Profit ($125)** to secure the funded account.  
* **Funded:** Switch to capital preservation (10% max loss).

## **1\. Challenge Risk Parameters**

The challenge rules are more generous than the funded stage. Use this extra room to secure the target, but don't over-leverage.

* **Daily Drawdown Limit:** $6\\% \= \\$150$ (Hard limit).  
* **Self-Imposed Daily Stop:** **$75 (3%)**.  
  * *Strategy:* Stop trading for the day if you hit this to avoid tilting toward the $150 breach.  
* **Total Drawdown Limit:** $12\\% \= \\$300$ (Static).  
* **Drawdown Type:** Static.  
  * *Advantage:* Your max loss is fixed at $2,200 equity. As you profit, your buffer grows.  
* **Target Risk per Trade:** $0.5\\% \- 1.0\\% \= \\$12.50 \- \\$25.00$.  
  * *Note:* You can risk slightly more in the challenge phase (1%) compared to the funded phase (0.5%) because the max drawdown is wider (12% vs 7-10%).

## **2\. Lot Size Strategy (Micro-Lots)**

**Instrument:** Forex Pairs or XAUUSD (Gold).

### **A. Forex Pairs (EURUSD, GBPUSD, etc.)**

**Risking $25 (1%):**

* **10 pip Stop Loss:** 0.25 Lots  
* **20 pip Stop Loss:** 0.12 Lots  
* **50 pip Stop Loss:** 0.05 Lots

### **B. XAUUSD (Gold) Specifics**

Gold is more volatile. A $1.00 move in price (e.g., 2000.00 to 2001.00) is equivalent to 10 "pips" or 100 points.

* **Contract Size:** Standard $1\~Lot \= 100oz$ ($1 move \= $100 PnL).

**Risking $25 (1%):**

1. **Scalp SL** ($2.00 move / 20 pips): **0.12 Lots**  
   * *Math:* $0.12 \\times 100oz \\times \\$2.00 \= \\$24.00$ Risk.  
2. **Day Trade SL** ($4.00 move / 40 pips): **0.06 Lots**  
   * *Math:* $0.06 \\times 100oz \\times \\$4.00 \= \\$24.00$ Risk.  
3. **Swing SL** ($5.00 move / 50 pips): **0.05 Lots**  
   * *Math:* $0.05 \\times 100oz \\times \\$5.00 \= \\$25.00$ Risk.

## **3\. Profit Targets (The "Passing" Goals)**

### **Phase 1: The Aggressive Phase**

* **Goal:** 8% ($200).  
* **Strategy:** 2 weeks to 4 weeks.  
* **Math:** You need 8 trades of \+2R (2% gain) or 16 trades of \+1R (1% gain).  
* **Weekly Goal:** 2%-3% ($50-$75).

### **Phase 2: The Consolidation Phase**

* **Goal:** 5% ($125).  
* **Strategy:** Slow down. The target is smaller.  
* **Risk Adjustment:** Drop risk per trade to **0.5% ($12.50)**.

## **4\. Trade Execution Plan**

* **Daily Limit:** Max 3 trades per day.  
* **Confluence:** Only take A+ setups (e.g., Trend \+ Support/Resistance \+ Key Level).  
* **News:** Avoid high-impact news if restricted, or reduce risk by 50%.

## **5\. Consistency & "Gaming" the Rules**

Even if the challenge doesn't strictly enforce the "20% consistency rule" for passing, behave as if it does to prepare for the Funded Stage.

* **Avoid:** Don't try to hit the full $200 target in one giant "lucky" trade.  
* **Aim For:** Steady wins of $20-$40.

## **6\. Weekly Roadmap (Phase 1 Example)**

|

| Week | Goal | Amount | Focus |  
| Week 1 | \+2.5% | $62.50 | Build a buffer above start balance. |  
| Week 2 | \+2.5% | $62.50 | Maintain rhythm. You are halfway there ($125). |  
| Week 3 | \+2.0% | $50.00 | Don't rush. Wait for setups. Total: $175. |  
| Week 4 | \+1.0% | $25.00 | Finish the remaining $25. Pass Phase 1\. |  
| Total | 8% | $200 | CHALLENGE PASSED |

## **7\. Financial Roadmap (When do you get paid?)**

* **Phase 1 (Evaluation):** You make $200 virtual profit. **Payout: $0.**  
* **Phase 2 (Verification):** You make $125 virtual profit. **Payout: $0.**  
* **Funded Account (Live):**  
  1. You must make a profit on the funded account (e.g., make $100 profit).  
  2. **First Payout:** You receive your Profit Split (e.g., 80% of $100 \= $80) **PLUS** your initial sign-up fee refund.

## **8\. Comprehensive Rules & Details**

### **A. The 20% Consistency Rule (Critical)**

* **Rule:** No single day's profit can exceed 20% of your Total Profit at the time of payout.  
* **Calculation:** $\\frac{\\text{Best Day Profit}}{\\text{Total Profit}} \= \\text{Consistency \\%}$

**Example of a Breach:**

* Total Profit: $200  
* Best Day: $100  
* Calculation: $100 / 200 \= 50\\%$ (**VIOLATION**)

**How to Fix a Breach:** You must keep trading small days to increase the "Total Profit" denominator without increasing the "Best Day" numerator.

* *Fix:* Trade 5 more days making $20 each. New Total \= $300. Best Day \= $100. Ratio \= 33%. Keep going until \< 20%.

### **B. Lot Size Consistency**

* **Rule:** Your average trade size must be consistent. You cannot trade 0.01 lots for a month and then slam a 1.0 lot trade to pass.  
* **Allowable Range:** For a $2.5K account, stay within a tight range.  
* **Example:** If your base size is 0.05 lots, stay between 0.03 and 0.07.  
* **Prohibited:** Switching from 0.05 to 0.50 is considered "Gambling/All-in" behavior.

### **C. Prohibited Strategies**

* **High Frequency Trading (HFT):** Bots that execute trades in milliseconds.  
* **Arbitrage:** Latency arbitrage or exploiting price delays.  
* **Grid / Martingale:** Adding to losing positions to "average out" a loss is often flagged as high-risk gambling.  
* **Account Management:** You must trade your own account. No "Pass Your Challenge" services.

### **D. Inactivity Rule**

* **Rule:** You must place at least one trade every 30 days.  
* **Consequence:** If inactive for \>30 days, the account may be breached/closed.
